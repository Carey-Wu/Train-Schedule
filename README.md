# Train-Schedule

This application was created using the following libraries: jquery, bootstrap, moment.js

This application is also linked to firebase to provide a database for the data that is input by the users.

Users can add train names, destinations, train frequency in minutes, and the initial start time of the train.  The application uses javascript to dynamically populate the list with that information and calculates the time of the next train and how long until then using javascript and moment.js.

Read through the documentation of moment.js to learn how to use it calculate times in the proper format that you're looking to display.
